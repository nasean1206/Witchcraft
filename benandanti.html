									<p>
									The Benandanti, or the "Good Walkers" were a peasant fertility cult in Friuli, who were poor and largely illiterate. Born with the caul over their head,
									the "Good Walkers" were a select group of men who were destined to fall into a deep slumber during a few days of the year 
									as a pseudo-military service to their society. This caul served as a lifetime protectivbe talisman that was worn in a pouch around the neck. The four days of the year, labeled the Ember Days, saw these "Good Walkers"
									traverse into the night realm, leaving their physical bodies behind, to battle aganist antagonistic witches in order to secure the fate of 
									the crop harvest. A triumph yielded a fertile harvest and the secured health of children; however, a defeat foreshadowed a harrowing famine and the death of children and animals.
									</p>									
									<p>
									This fertility cult came to the attention of the Friulian Church authorities in 1575 when witchcraft accusations were filed toward Paolo Gasparotto.
									Gasparotto among locals were interrogated by Roman Catholic Inquisitors. As the Benandanti claimed to be for the Church, the Inquisition viewed them as acting beyond the paradigm of the Church by participating in these <i>diabolical</i> night battles. However, generations of Benandanti were released leading up to the 17th century, as inquisitors tended to give up interrogating the Benandanti. Generally, sentences of mild heresy (punished by paying penance and temporary banishment) were given out. 
										</p>
										<p>
										However, the attention that was given to these "Good Walkers" by the rest of European society led to its decline. Unfortunate to the Benandanti, the number of cases over the years led to the progressive increase in notoriety. The consequences of this notoriety were fleshed out as the publicâ€™s attention was drawn to these strange trials of peasants who engaged in practices that seemed eerily similar to that of witchcraft as laid out by the Malleus Maleficarum. As time wore on, under the pressure by the Inquisition who began using torture tactics, the Benandanti allowed their noctural rituals
									to be attributed to the diabolical stereotypes of the witches' Sabbath. The Benandanti were soon condemned for their heretical acts of witchcraft, which eventually
									wiped them out from Friuli by the 17th century.
