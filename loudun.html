									<p>
									August 18, 1634 saw the prosecution and confession of Father Urbain Grandier for engaging in the bewitchment of Ursuline nuns in Loudun. This tragic case climaxed in the gruesome torture and execution of Grandier at the hands of his own exorcists, now known as the <b>Loudun Possessions</b>.</p>									
									<p>
									A handsome man who was charming and articulate, albeit arrogant and promiscuous, Grandier was hated by powerful people for contradicting religious doctrine among other reasons. Rumors about Grandier were spread around Loudun – he had written “a little handwritten book against the celibacy of priests.”12 Seen as a contradiction of religion by many, Grandier was a man of the cloth who also indulged in worldly desires with women. Unfortunate to him, other pamphlets Grandier wrote indirectly defamed King Louis XIII and gained the attention of Cardinal Richelieu; slander towards Grandier started to gain momentum in the form of witchcraft accusations. Despite his attempts to discredit, and even mock, the allegations when they were first introduced, the sheer power of Richelieu’s words and judgement proved his fate to be inevitable. The church held powerful authority during this time, even with the gradual shift towards science.</p>
										<p>
										Although the advent of medicine began to supplant prayer, most medical practitioners with any sense knew not to challenge Richelieu and the church during this era where the church still had sweeping influence; few physicians dared to be outspoken against demonic possession in fear of being charged with heresy. 
									</p>
                  <p>
                  It had been reported that the Ursuline convent started to notice bizarre events occurring in September 1632 – the spectral silhouette of Grandier had been seen wandering around the convent at night.13 Over the course of a few months, nuns had fallen under possession; they spoke with demonic voices and entered into uncontrollable convulsions. 
									</p>
                  <p>
                  With Grandier’s reputation becoming tarnished in the eyes of prominent church figures and the monarchy, he was seen as a scapegoat target as the man behind the diabolical possessions that started to take place at Loudun. Coming to trial for witchcraft, the decision for Grandier’s case was already a pre-determined one; Grandier was sentenced to be burned alive at the stake for his heretical actions of diabolism and possession.
