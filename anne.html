									Newcomers to the village of North Moreton, the Gunters immediately did not fare well with the townspeople due to their infamous reputation. Because Brian Gunter was a man who profited off local farmers through buying up impropriated tithes, the society of North Moreton saw the Gunters more as interlopers and less as welcome members to their village. Unfortunate for Brian, 1598 saw a brawl break out a local football match in which Brian fatally wounded two brothers, John and Richard Gregory, who both died days later. Demanding righteousness for Brian’s actions, the Gregorys attempted to indict Brian with manslaughter; unfortunately, though they were unsuccessful and the charges were drop, Brian established a personal vendetta with the Gregorys as a result. 
									</p>	
									<p>
									Years later, Brian’s revenge came to fruition as he directed witchcraft accusations towards the Gregory family, specifically wife Elizabeth. Elizabeth Gregory was notorious for being a troublemaker, getting into exchanges with neighbors, and was generally outspoken -- these characteristics made her a great choice for Brian and his accusations because they paralleled those of a stereotypical witch of the time. Anne Gunter, Brian’s daughter, played into these accusations as being possessed by Elizabeth in 1604 through displaying the stereotypical symptoms of demonic possession -- fits, contortions, trances, and vomiting to name a few. Spitting pins from her mouth along with vomiting were two signs that solidified the authenticity of the possession; Elizabeth along with two other women were then put on trial for witchcraft.  
									</p>
									<p>
									Thomas Hinton, a distant relative of the Gunters, came to North Moreton to witness the spectacle of Anne’s possession. Although he originally intended to see an authentic demonic possession, second thoughts brought him to the conclusion that this entire affair was fraudulent. He then warned the judges that the possession seemed suspicious and disingenuous as a whole affair, which led to an intense scrutinization of the presented evidence (more so than usual at these witchcraft trials). The three accused women were then acquitted rather than hanged most likely due to Hinton’s intervention.      
									</p>
									<p>
									Though Brian’s attempts at revenge failed, Brian pressed on with different tactics. The summer of 1605 saw King James I come to Oxford; the Gunters presented their case once more, except to the king this time. However, this plan backfired as both King James I and Archbishop Richard Bancroft were extremely skeptical of this entire ordeal, leading to the confession of Anne’s artificial possession. He had coerced Anne into accusing the three women, taught her to spit pins and vomit, and gave her drugs to put her into trances -- Brian was tried before the Star Chamber for his actions, and was permanently disgraced as a result.
