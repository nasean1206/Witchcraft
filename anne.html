									<p><img src="gunter.jpg" alt="Smiley face" width="136" height="210" align="middle" style="margin:0px 50px">James Sharpe weaves an intricate tale of death, deception, disputation – and an own goal. This slip was not committed on the village soccer pitch, but in Oxford in 1605 when Brian Gunter brought his apparently bewitched pin-vomiting daughter to the attention of James I, a man not remembered for his footballing prowess (unlike his republican successor Cromwell), but known for taking more than a passing interest in witchcraft. Gunter, still at loggerheads with the Gregorys over his homicidal tackle in 1598, had failed to have Elizabeth Gregory, and two other women of dubious reputation, convicted as witches, and so took his complaint to the top. Royal scepticism, however, unravelled Gunter’s scheme. Eminent doctors and churchmen (including the Archbishop of Canterbury) were wheeled in for comment, and once Anne had been summoned before the Court of Star Chamber in 1606, Gunter’s fate was sealed. Within these imposing precincts, she confessed again what she had told the King: her father had forced her to simulate bewitchment, including making her drink the ingredients of a passable vinaigrette in emetic quantities.</p>
									<p>Historians of witchcraft face two acute problems with sources: finding and interpreting them. In the compendious legal file upon which this account depends, Professor Sharpe has struck gold – his words not mine. I remember meeting him in the tearoom of the Institute of Historical Research within days of its discovery, and now I have read the book I understand his excitement. I also recall, to my shame, previously having found the file and shying away from the fat slab of paper filled to the margins with Jacobean scrawl. It reflects Sharpe’s expertise that he has managed to fillet this raw produce and prepare it so attractively for the table. Aiming at a readership beyond academia, he never assumes esoteric knowledge, and most importantly puts the story first, compelling non-specialists to stay the distance. In his preface, however, he might have avoided calling his story ‘fascinating’ (or Anne’s testimony ‘convincing’), just as a comedian should never tell an audience that his jokes are funny. These are matters for the reader. That said, as a reader, I can confirm that it is a rattling good yarn, albeit one without a proper end. Documentary silence permits only speculation about Gunter’s fate (mild punishment), and as far as Anne was concerned, well, we know she fell in love. And she probably grew up a bit as well.</p>
									<p>Elsewhere, authorial detachment from village conspiracies and beard-stroking in the corridors of power, allows readers to decide the truth for themselves, and to determine what this episode tells us about preindustrial lives and minds. Like all good microhistories, this book instructs as well as entertains. It demonstrates that before the English Civil War, an expanding legal and literate culture sometimes allowed social conflict between ordinary villagers to assume national significance, and that debates about witchcraft and demonic possession articulated and exposed contrasting shades of religious and political opinion. At a simpler level, we have to confront the fact that however much our ancestors resemble us in their hopes and fears, likes and dislikes – even their love of football – they did not operate mentally within quite the same parameters. Nor should the scepticism of the King and his advisers be inflated in its significance: calling Brian Gunter’s bluff was not the same as calling time on the prosecution of witches. That would not happen in any of their lifetimes.</p>
