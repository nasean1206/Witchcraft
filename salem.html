									The spring of 1692 saw the start of the infamous <b>Salem witch trials</b>. Claiming to be possessed by the spirit of the Devil, a group of young girls in Salem, Massachusetts began unsubstantiated witchcraft accusations of several women within the village. With this spark in the witchcraft craze saw the widespread hunt of witches throughout colonial Massachusetts that culminated in a specialized court established in Salem that oversaw trials against accused witches. June of 1692 saw the execution of Bridget Bishop as the first convicted witch; over several months in 1692 saw more than 150 men, women, and children accused of witchcraft. However, by September of 1692 the witch craze died down and public opinion shifted against the witchcraft court. By the end of the year, the Massachusetts General Court began to annul guilty verdicts against accused witches (at least those who were still alive) and compensation to affected families, but the bitterness that fueled family factions within the village along with the enduring legacy of the Salem witch trials lingered.</p>
									<p>
									January of 1692 saw Abigail Williams (niece of Samuel Parris, the minister of Salem Village) and Elizabeth Parris (daughter of Samuel Parris) having demonic fits that included horrific contortions as well as violent screaming outbursts. Other young girls throughout Salem (Ann Putnam Jr., Mercy Lewis, Mary Walcott, Elizabeth Hubbard, and Mary Warren) suddenly emerged with the same symptoms of possession after William Griggs, the village physician, diagnosed Abigail and Elizabeth with bewitchment. Confessions of the bewitched girls accused other local women in the village such as Tituba (Parris’ Caribbean slave), Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborn -- warrants were then issued for the arrest of these accused witches.</p>
									<p>
									Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborn were brought into the legal sphere of Salem and questioned by Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne (magistrates of Salem village) for their involvement with witchcraft. With the bewitched young girls in court performing their grandiose symptoms of bewitchment (contortions, screaming, and outbursts), Tituba confessed to this bewitchment at the dismay of Sarah Good and Osborn (who denied their involvement). It’s likely that Tituba’s confession acted as a proactive defense against heresy, as she established her value as an informer of the court by declaring a sect of witches within the village that served the Devil. With the witch craze now picking up pace not only in Salem but also the rest of Massachusetts, many others were accused of witchcraft such as Martha Corey and Rebecca Nurse; the tragic irony behind these accusations were that these two women were honorable members of the community and church.</p>
									<p>
									With similar intentions to that of Tituba, several other accused villagers confessed to witchcraft and named other conspirators, which overloaded the simple courts of Salem. As a result, William Phips (appointed governor of Massachusetts) established the Court of Oyer and Terminer for witchcraft cases through Massachusetts in May of 1692. These courts were led by Judges Hathorne, Samuel Sewall, and William Stoughton; execution sentences at Gallows Hill began to be handed out throughout that entire year starting on June 2nd with Bridget Bishop. Many other accused died in jail, while relatives of accused witches died as a collateral result such as Giles Corey, who was pressed to death by stones after failing to confess at his arraignment.</p>
									<p>
									Although Cotton Mather (reputable minister of Salem) had issued warnings of the legitimacies of spectral evidence, his advice was largely ignored during the trials. Increase Mather joined his son in arguing that the standards of evidence during the Salem witch trials ought to be equivalent for any other trial, even going on to say that “It would better that ten suspected witches may escape than one innocent person be condemned.” With dwindling public support for witch hunting, Governor Phips declared the dissolution of the Court of Oyer and Terminer in October of 1692 as well as the future disregard for spectral evidence. Spring of 1693 saw Phips annul the accused who were in prison for witchcraft charges.</p>
