									The <b>Witches of Warboys</b> is the title of the accusation, trial, and execution of suspected witch Alice Samuel and her family that took place at Warboys from 1589 to 1593. November 1589 saw the Throckmorton family make the first accusations that declared Alice as a witch. These allegations were a result of twelve servants in the Throckmorton household who felt the brunt of Alice’s witchcraft through violent fits, trances, and outbursts. Daughter Jane Throckmorton also suffered from these violent fits detailed such as: "Sometimes she would sneeze very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie."</p>
									<p>
									With Jane’s mother and grandmother by her bedside, other neighbors came into the household to check on her health. However, when Alice Samuel walked into the room, Jane shrieked: “Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth; did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed cap, for I cannot abide to look on her.” At first, the Throckmorton brushed her qualms aside, attributing it to sleep deprivation, dehydration, and illness. However, with her condition quickly deteriorating, the family brought her to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge who diagnosed her with bewitchment after traditional medicines failed to heal her. Exactly a month later, two more daughters of the Throckmorton family fell down with the same sickness that plagued Jane. All three daughters lost their sight, sound, and touch while plagued with the bewitchment fits, and accused Alice Samuel. When the fits subsided however, the daughters could recall no part in what they said or did.<sup>1</sup></p>

									March of 1590 saw Lady Cromwell and Alice discussing the witchcraft accusations made against Alice. In the midst of dialogue, Lady Cromwell was noted as cutting off a lock of Alice’s hair off with a pair of scissors to give to Mrs. Throckmorton; burning a witch’s hair was known to weaken a witch’s power. However, that same night, Lady Cromwell began having similar fits and nightmares, later passing away from illness in 1592. The death of Lady Cromwell surged wild unsubstantiated accusations against Alice in admitting witchcraft. Finally confessing before the Bishop of Lincoln, she was admitted into prison with the rest of her family in Huntingdon; she was later tried for the witchcraft death of Lady Cromwell in April 1593. Reported evidence against Alice came in the form of a quick exchange to Lady Cromwell: “Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet.” This evidence, used against Alice and her family at trial, was taken as an admission of guilt. Alice Samuel and her family were eventually hanged that same year.<sup>2</sup>									</p>
